Adriano tab defintions

> for the bigtab we have:
>    #mod    = number of model
>    log(t)  = logarithm of the Age
>    H/HE    = Central Hydrgen abunnance or central Helium abundance
>    logL    = logarithm of surface luminosity (in solar units)
>    logTe   = logarithm of the effective temperature
>    logTc   = logarithm of the central temperature
>    logRc   = logarithm of the central density
>    Mcc     = mass (in solar units) of the convective core
>    M_cHe   = mass (in solar units) of the Helium core
>    M_cCO   = mass (in solar units) of the Carbon and Oxigen core
>    Mce     = mass (in solar units) of the convective envelope
>    Lpp/Ls  = ratio between the energy produced by proton-proton chain and
> the surface luminosity
>    Lcno/Ls = ratio between the energy produced by CNO cycle and the
> surface luminosity
>    L3a/Ls  = ratio between the energy produced by Helium burning and the
> surface luminosity
>    Lgr/Ls  = ratio between the gravitational energy and the surface
> luminosity
>    He_sup  = the amount of surface Helium
>    Mtot    = total mass (in solar units)
>    log(Tmax) = logarithm of the maximum out center temperature
>
> For the asttab, the first 5 quantities are as in the bigtab, while for
> the other:
>
>    log(R/Ro) =  logarithm of Radius (in solar units)
>    Mcc/M      =  ratio between the mass of the convective core and the
> total mass
>    Rcc/R       =  ratio between the Radius of the convective core and the
> total radius
>    Mce/M       =  ratio between the mass of the convective envelope and
> the total mass
>    Rce/R      =  ratio between the mass of the convective envelope and
> the total radius
>    Mtot/Mo =   total mass (in solar units)
>    P-sp =  period spacing (in second)
