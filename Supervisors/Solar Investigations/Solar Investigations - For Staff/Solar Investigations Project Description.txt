Solar Investigations Project

Supervisor: David Hyder

As the Sun is by far our closest star, studying it gives us valuable insight into the nuclear processes, affects of convection, and magnetic fields associated with stars, and can help us understand stellar lifetimes more clearly. By understanding the processes involved with the nuclear fusion process, we can also attempt to recreate the process here on Earth to end the energy crisis.

The purpose of this project is two-fold, to determine the rotation period of the Sun using data from the GONG solar telescope on Tenerife, and to investigate one hundred years of sunspot data, to see if any patterns emerge.

Rotation Period:

This data is from the GONG (http://gong.nso.edu/) solar telescope, taken through an H-Alpha filter. The provided observations were taken every day, and as close to noon 
as conditions allowed. You will have to use ds9 (http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/site/Home.html) to view the images and to make measurements.

Sunspot Data:

The data provided gives the number of sunspots recorded duirng the years 2000 and 2007, whilst a seperate dataset gives less regular sunspot readings from 1900 to 2008. Import these into Excel and determine whether any short or long term patterns exist and try to explain your results.


TIPS:

(1) Learn more about the Sun and Sunspots (Web Search)
(2) Investigate safe ways of observing the Sun (Web Search)
(3) Use the ARI's own solar telescope to observe and record the Sun (ask Supervisor)
(4) Learn about the GONG solar network (http://gong.nso.edu/)
(5) Learn about ther ds9 software (http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/site/Documentation.html)
(6) Remind yourself how to measure brightness with LTImage
(7) Conduct meaurements on the data
(8) Present results using Excel and draw up your conclusions
(9) Write a 1000 word report and a 10 minute presentation
