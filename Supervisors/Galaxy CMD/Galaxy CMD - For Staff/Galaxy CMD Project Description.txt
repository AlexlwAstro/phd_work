Project: Galaxy Colour-Magnitude Diagram and Classification

Supervisor: Claire Burke and Chris Collins

The galaxy contains hunderds of billions of galaxies, which we classify into 4 real groups. However, the varation within each group is enormous, and generally galaxies lie on a kind of spectrum. One way to classify them more appropriately is using a Colour Magnitude Diagram (CMD), this is one of the most well known diagrams used to investigate the properties of galaxies. 

It's important to understand the characteristics of galaxies over time to explore the evolution of the Universe since the creation of the first galaxies to now. Also to try and understand why we see the different groups of galaxies we observe today - why do they look different, and does one eventually become another? We still don't know how galaxies evolve over time, or how they are formed. The more we investigate their properties, the better handle we can get on understanding these bigger questions.

You have been given data from the Liverpool Telescope of a sample of different galaxies in two filters. In this project you should aim to produce a Colour-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) for the galaxies to compare their features. You can also classify these galaxies to explain features of the CMD, and/or create a Hubble Tuning Fork.

TIPS:

(1) Learn more about Galaxy Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (Web Search)
(2) Learn more about different galaxy types, and where you would expect to find them on a CMD (Web Search)
(3) Read about the Liverpool Telescope (Web Search)
(4) Remind yourself how to measure brightnesses with LTImage
(5) Take measurements of the data
(6) Present your results using Excel and draw up your conclusions
(7) Write a 1000 word report and prepare a 10 minute presentation
