Exoplanets Project

Supervisor: Alex Lisboa-Wright

Many people ask the question "are we alone in the Universe?" and astronomers have been attempting to answer this for hundreds of years. We now have the technology to find planets around other stars, and soon we'll have the ability to look for atmospheres around these planets to see if they contain any molecules which have been produced by some lifeform. Finding enough planets to study is the first step, then once we find those planets inferring their size and distance from the star will help us to decide whether life might be able to survive. You are going to analyse one such planet which was found in 2007.

Hat-P-5 is a spectral type G star located 340 (± 30) parsecs away. In 2007, the HATNet transit search programme identified a possible transiting planet around the host star, which was later confirmed by spectoscopic observations.
The results of those observations gave the following orbital characteristics:

Star Data:

Type: G
Mass: 1.16 (+- 0.062) Solar Masses
Radius: 1.167 (+- 0.049) Solar Radii
Age: 2.6 (+-1.8) Giga Years (Estimated)

Planet Data:

Orbital Period: 2.7884491 (+- 0.000025) days
Transit Duration: 0.1217 (+- 0.0012) days
Mass: 1.06 Jupiter Masses
Radius 1.26 Jupiter Radii
Surface Temperature: ~1500 Kelvin

Follow up observations were carried out on the Liverpool Telescope in July 2009, using the RiSE instrument, and the data was planned to span a timeframe of 4.5 hours and to encompass the whole of the transit.

This project is to conduct photometric measurements on a subset of that data, with a view to tracking changes in brightness as the planet passes in front of its parent star. You will use LTImage and EXCEL to present your results.


TIPS:

(1) Learn more about planetary transits (Web Search)
(2) Investigate other planetary detection methods (Web Search)
(3) Learn about HAT-P-5 using SIMBAD (http://simbak.cfa.harvard.edu/simbad/)
(4) Try to determine which star is HAT-P-5 using DSS (http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form)
(3) Learn about the Liverpool Telescope (http://www.schoolsobservatory.org.uk/astro/tels/lt)
(4) Learn about the RiSE instrument (http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/Info/TelInst/Inst/RISE/)
(5) Remind yourself how to measure brightness with LTImage
(6) Conduct meaurements on the data
(7) Present results using Excel and draw up your conclusions
(8) Write a 1000 word report and a 10 minute presentation
