Variable Star Project
Supervisor: David Bersier


This project is to give students an appreciation that not all stars
exist in a steady state, and that some stars can vary in brightness
quite markedly for a number of reasons. A dataset will be provided
for an unidentified variable star (centre of the field) that needs
to have its brightness measured and the nature of its variability
determined.


TIPS:

(1) Learn more about Variable Stars (Web Search)
(2) Investigate the different types of Variable Star (Web Search)
(3) Learn about the Liverpool Telescope (http://www.schoolsobservatory.org.uk/astro/tels/lt)
(4) Learn about the RATCam instrument (http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/Info/TelInst/Inst/RATCam/)
(5) Remind yourself how to measure brightness with LTImage
(6) Conduct meaurements on the data
(7) Present results using Excel and draw up your conclusions
(8) Write a 1000 word report and a 10 minute presentation
