Improved franec_stampe_plots to include functions for isolating nuclear fusion regions (ENUC > 1)
Checked that all data are represented for all relevant mesh points.
Wrote out nuclear data to new files.
Plotted ln(mu) and dln(mu)/dlnP versus P, sent plots, together with nuclear data, to Maurizio

Discussed viability of thermohaline mixing conditions in nuclear plots/data with Maurizio - conditions appear to be viable.
Resolved burning data file writing issues - was missing command for newline and abundance data was being written to both abundance and model files
Sent resolved files to Maurizio
This mistake did not change previous conclusions, as these were based on correct data arrays.
Met with Stellar Pops group.
Met with Steve - recommendation to reduce the scale of plot to show the mu-gradient inversion - this was done in franec_stampe_plots.
Received email for Maurizio for next stages.

Read observational paper about rotation & magnetic fields in one B-type star
Started work on outputting dX/dr for C12, N12, Li7 - compare the output from a new FRANEC run with python data crunching to see which data is hidden or lost
This could lead to shortcuts later.
