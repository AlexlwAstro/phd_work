Hi Lina,

Here (below) is the merged list of corrections for Alex from both examiners.

Merged List of amendments for A Lisboa-Wright (MPhil): January 2020

N.B. the starred items are the most important, but all items should be addressed in he revised version.
Please also provide a list of responses indicating what has been done on each point and where the new
or amended work is to be found (i.e page and section references).

****ALW comment: I will add "**TICK**" to items that I think have been addressed in the revised thesis.****

Clarifications:

*Make the distinction between and relative contributions of interstellar dust and gas to extinction clear in
the Introduction section, as in the discussion in the viva (esp. decide whether passages concerning atoms on
pages 3 & 4, page 8, and similar, are appropriate and if so, explain why).

*Qualitatively explain the effect under consideration (the effect of spectral slopes and added extinction in a
broad-band filter), as per the initial moments of the viva and with a figure. Also mention that the effect is
commonly recognised and known as colour correction.

*Quantify the effect that is the main subject of the thesis. It would seem that Figs 3.1 and 3.2 provide this
information. So, a (clearer and simplified) version of Sec. 3.1, and 3.2 plus the figures should be moved
forward to before Sec 2.2. These graphs provide the main justification for the research conducted.

Clarify why Bolometric Corrections need to be computed when one is interested in individual filters.

*Clarify the data of the test case. In particular, discuss later Gaia DR2 results for the cluster, as these give an
idea of the uncertainties involved, even when considering the same data.

*Reconsider the order of sections in the thesis. For example, much of chapter 3 should be discussed before
fitting isochrones are mentioned or treated.

Check when any variables are defined and first mentioned in, especially, chapter 3. They should be defined
and introduced before they are used. (e.g. in 3.2: introduce Fig 3.2 and then describe what it shows).

Clarify and make consistent Tables 3.1 and 3.2

Justify the choice of Av=1 as a test value (i.e. by giving the distribution of Av in known clusters of the
appropriate type).

Identify the curves in Figure 2.2

Streamline and simplify the text and figures in sections 3.3 � 3.10

*Explain more about fitting isochrones � e.g. the fact that the MS fitting is mostly insensitive to age and
metallicity, but very dependent on extinction.

Highlight the Blue Stragglers, binaries etc.

*Justify all qualitative judgements about results and assumptions quantitatively (e.g. �acceptable�,
�reasonable�, �plausible� on p. 26).

*The discussions of natural line (and pressure) broadening on p.8 appear irrelevant and should be justified (in
terms of quantified effect on the broad-band spectrum) or deleted.

*In 1.2.2, explain more carefully why the Forbes effect is relevant, since we observe extinction empirically. If
it introduces a bias, explain how this manifests and how large the effect is, with a plot, if necessary.

*In 1.3 (p12): �This makes the notion�� needs clarifying. Extinction produces relative losses, so the fraction
lost at a given wavelength is the same. If this passage refers to the colour-correction problem, then make the
connection clear.

2.1.1: the discussion of Vega appears to refer to the need for a flux standard, since the magnitude scale is
arbitrary. Vega is an A0 star with (in principle) mag = 0 at all wavelengths. Make this point.

2.2.2: explain why 50Myr and 12Gyr are chosen.

2.3: �a significant impact� quantify significant (see above).

2.4: para 1: �significant variations�: quantify.

2.6: Give more information on why this cluster is chosen as the test case (especially given that it has no easily
definable MSTO).

Add short introductions and/or linking statements to each section to lead the reader through the narrative
(e.g., Sect 2.4 might start with The next step is to determine� )

Consider the order of text in some paragraphs (e.g. 3.2 p. 31: �Plots of Ax/Av against�.� should come before
discussion of what is in the plot)

Ch 3: in a Results section, it is usual to state the (numerical) results up front or refer to the relevant figure. Do
this where possible.

3.2 p. 32: �a property found in the data�� explain where we see this (i.e., refer to the relevant figure. Also,
explain more clearly and directly whether the inverted gradient is a numerical artefact and so whether it
needs to be considered. Can it be remedied, e.g. with a finer integration grid?

3.3: p. 32: �degeneracy between coefficients� explain which ones.

*The text on p 35 etc., is impenetrable and needs cimpifying and clarifying.

Justify discussion of consideration of the range of Teff = 50,000K considered (e.g. 50,000K on p31) in terms of
stars likely to be observed in clusters under consideration.

We suggest testing the placement of the MSTO in Fig 3.13 by predicting the likelihood of finding the two stars
near the top of the MS to be MS or post-MS, given the number of stars in the cluster and therefore the
exected number of stars in that position in the CMD.

Additional work:

*Select cluster members on proper motion as well.

*Compare results of using individual stellar parallax distances with that of putting all cluster members at
same, mean, distance (including those with negative parallaxes).

*Check and present errors on absolute magnitudes.

*Check the photometric errorbars on Gaia data and discuss whether they are really negligible.

Discuss the potential presence of binaries in the CMD and whether they should be corected for or ignored in
the fit.

*Get confidence intervals on the (newly) derived parameters for the cluster.

*Demonstrate how other models compare to the �best fitting� model.

A nice demonstration would be the GC18 isochrone computed with the new extinction values.

*Provide a quantitative assessment of the differences in the new and standard methods wth respect to the
uncertainties and the success of and/or need for a new method. i.e., quantitatively justify your conclusions.

*Add your key, quantified results to the Abstract.


Typos and minor corrections:

p2 para 1: �of the electromagnetic spectrum�

p3 para 1: �refraction or diffraction� should be scattering

text after equations that is not the start of a new paragraph should not be indented.

p4 para 2: explain in more detail why Q ~ a/lambda and lambda ~ a sigma implies sigma ~ 1/lambda. Also in
para 2, �scattering cross section" should be extinction cross section (the sum of absorption and scattering).

p.8: �wave3.4length� at the end.

p.9: last para: �the flux in the redder filter�� should be magnitude

p. 10: para 2: "widely-used" - widely used (only hyphenate compound adjectives) para 3: �know� -> known

p.12: "use distinctive" -> use of distinctive

p. 17: para 3: �an object�s emission� should be an object�s detected flux (or magnitude).

p. 18: final para: �equal to A_lambda for � filter X�: should be either A_x or filter lambda? clarify.

p. 25 last para: �this data� -> these data (and anywhere else this occurs)

p. 30 last para: isochrone with..were� -> isochrone with� was

p. 36: explain �sigmoid� and �logistic function�

p.39: �for each of these plots�: which plots?
